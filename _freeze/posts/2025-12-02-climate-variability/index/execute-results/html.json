Distribution of Mean Annual Precipitation in Puerto Rico](usgs_annual_precip_map.jpg)\n\nPrecipitation patterns in Puerto Rico are shaped by a combination of tropical atmospheric processes and topographic influences. As shown in U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) climatological analyses (Figure 1), pronounced orographic effects from the Cordillera Central and Sierra de Cayey create substantial spatial variability in rainfall. Trade winds carrying moisture rise along the northern windward slopes and result in the production of high precipitation totals north of the hydrologic divide, while the southern coastal plain lies within a rain shadow, resulting in considerably lower annual rainfall (USGS, 2016).\n\nGlobally, these local precipitation dynamics occur against the backdrop of broader changes in the hydrological cycle. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2023) reports that globally averaged precipitation over land has likely increased since 1950, with the rate of increase accelerating after the 1980s. Human influence has likely contributed to both observed changes in precipitation patterns. The IPCC also notes that mid-latitude storm tracks have likely shifted poleward since the 1980s and affected large-scale circulation patterns that interact with tropical moisture and storm systems.\n\nUnderstanding intensity of rainfall events also requires a clear definition of what constitutes an “extreme event.” According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, 2020), an extreme event occurs when weather or climate conditions fall near the upper or lower ends of the historical range. Although thresholds vary, scientists often classify extremes as events in the top 5–10% of historical measurements. This percentile-based definition allows for meaningful comparisons over time even as climate baselines shift.\n\nTogether, these drivers provide context for evaluating long-term changes in extreme rainfall at the San Juan Airport station. In a humid tropical island setting where orographic lifting, ocean–atmosphere interactions, and global climate variability shape precipitation, it is meaningful for climate resilience planning to assess whether extreme rainfall events have become more frequent. Motivated by these factors, this study investigates the following question: **Have extreme precipitation events increased in Puerto Rico over the past 50 years?**\n\nTo explore this question, I analyzed 50 years of daily precipitation data from NOAA’s weather station at the San Juan International Airport. I calculated the number of extreme precipitation events per year, using a threshold of X mm. Then I used a Negative Binomial model, which is well-suited for count data that show more variation than what a Poisson model can comfortably handle.\n\nMy goal is simple:\nIs San Juan experiencing more extreme rainfall events now compared to the 1970s?\n\nIf so, how much of this change can be explained by broader climate patterns like El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), or changes in sea surface temperature (SST)?\n\n\n# Why a Negative Binomial Model?\nThe response variable in this project is the number of extreme precipitation events per year. This is a form of count data, and the simplest model for counts is the Poisson model. However, the Poisson model assumes that the mean and variance of the data are equal. That is not true for precipitation extremes.\n\nSome years have many extreme events, while other years have very few, leading to overdispersion, the variance exceeds the mean. The Negative Binomial model adds an extra dispersion parameter that relaxes the strict Poisson assumption, making it a better fit for environmental count data.\nThis is especially important for events like extreme rainfall, which are influenced by seasonal cycles, climate modes, and storm activity.\n\n# Data Exploration\n\nThis analysis uses three publicly available NOAA datasets such as daily precipitation from the San Juan International Airport (1946–2025), the ENSO index (Niño 3.4 anomaly), a measure of El Niño/La Niña conditions, and SST anomaly in from the Tropical Northern Atlantic, extracted from NOAA’s ERSSTv5 dataset.\n\nBefore fitting the statistical model, I explored the raw precipitation data to understand its distribution. Daily precipitation values were obtained from NOAA for the San Juan International Airport station from 1946–2025. Figure X shows the full record of daily precipitation at the San Juan International Airport from 1975 to the present. Most days receive little to no rainfall, with frequent low–to–moderate precipitation events and occasionally very high-intensity spikes above 5 inches.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|fig-cap: \"Daily Rainfall-San Juan Int'l Airport Station (1975-2025)\"\n# Daily Precipitation (raw data)\nggplot(precip_daily, aes(x=Date, y=`PRCP (Inches)`)) +\n  geom_line(alpha=.6, colour = \"#2d8cbd\") +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Daily Rainfall (in)\") +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n  \nDaily precipitation amounts from 1975–2025 exhibit a strongly right-skewed distribution, with most days receiving little to no rainfall and a long tail marked by the high-intensity events.

The model estimates closely aligned with these values. The fitted effects for the year (0.011), ENSO (–0.039), NAO (–0.690), and TNA SST (0.108) reflect both the direction and approximate magnitude of the true coefficients. Minor deviations are expected due to random variation in the simulated counts, but overall, the fitted model successfully recovers the structure of the simulation.\n\nOne possible reason for this outcome is that small slopes are harder to recover unless the sample size is very large. That being said, the model NAO displayed a strong negative; SST, a light positive, ENSO, a small effect; and year, a small positive trend.

The predicted line slopes slightly downward, indicating a small decrease in extreme event frequency over the 50-year period. The confidence interval widens toward the earlier years, reflecting greater uncertainty at the edges of the dataset. Overall, the effect of year is relatively weak compared to the climate indices included in the model, and this visualization supports the conclusion that time alone does not explain changes in extreme precipitation. Instead, the variability in extremes appears to be more strongly associated with climate conditions such as ENSO and Atlantic SST rather than a simple linear trend over time.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|code-fold: true\n#|fig-cap: \"Effect of Tropical Northern Atlantic SST on Extreme Precipitation Events\"\n\n# Prediction grid for TNA SST\npred_sst <- expand_grid(\n  avg_sst = seq(min(clim_data$avg_sst),\n                 max(clim_data$avg_sst),\n                 length.out = 100)) %>%\n  mutate(avg_enso_anom = mean(clim_data$avg_enso_anom, na.rm = TRUE),\n         avg_nao_index = mean(clim_data$avg_nao_index, na.rm = TRUE),\n         year_ref = mean(clim_data$year_ref, na.rm = TRUE))\n    \n\n# Predictions on link scale\npred_sst_se <- predict(clim_model,\n                        newdata = pred_sst,\n                        type = \"link\",\n                        se.fit = TRUE)\n\npred_sst_nb <- pred_sst %>%\n  mutate(log_pred = pred_sst_se$fit,\n         \n         log_lwr = qnorm(0.025, log_pred, pred_sst_se$se.fit),\n         log_upr = qnorm(0.975, log_pred, pred_sst_se$se.fit),\n         \n         pred = exp(log_pred),\n         pred_lwr = exp(log_lwr),\n         pred_upr = exp(log_upr))\n    \n\n# Plot\nggplot(pred_sst_nb, aes(x = avg_sst, y = pred)) +\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = pred_lwr, ymax = pred_upr),\n              fill = \"#5b8484\", alpha = .3) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1, color = \"firebrick\") +\n  labs(x = \"Tropical Atlantic Sea Surface Temperature (Celsius)\",\n       y = \"Predicted Number of Extreme Events\") +\n  theme_classic()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFigure Y illustrates the modeled relationship between Tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and the expected number of extreme precipitation events in San Juan. As SST increases, the predicted count of extreme events rises sharply and the uncertainty band widens at higher temperatures. This pattern suggests that warmer Atlantic conditions are associated with a greater likelihood of extreme rainfall.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAlthough the year variable itself did not show a positive linear trend, the model results point to a more nuanced picture. ENSO anomalies and Atlantic SSTs were both significant predictors of extreme precipitation frequency, indicating that large-scale climate variability plays a key role in shaping extreme rainfall in San Juan. This suggests that changes in extreme precipitation cannot be attributed to time alone, but instead emerge from the combined influence of warming Atlantic waters and shifts in El Niño/La Niña conditions. The model therefore highlights that the frequency of extremes is tied to climate dynamics rather than a simple linear trend over the past 50 years.\n\nSeveral limitations should be considered when interpreting these findings. Extreme precipitation in the Caribbean is strongly influenced by tropical cyclone activity, yet hurricane frequency and intensity were not included in the model and could confound the observed associations. Other large-scale climate modes, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) or the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) may also shape rainfall extremes and interact with ENSO and SST in ways not captured here. Additionally, the negative coefficient for year may reflect the model’s inability to capture nonlinear or regime-based changes in precipitation patterns. Finally, the definition of extreme events is dependent on a threshold. Different thresholds could yield different trends.\n\nFuture work could expand this analysis by incorporating storm-specific data, including annual tropical cyclone counts to better capture the influence of hurricane activity on extreme precipitation. The model does not incorporate lagged climate effects, even though variables like ENSO and SST often influence precipitation with delays of several months, so a model that incorporates that factor may likely gain even more insights in the temporal dynamics that shape extreme rainfall in Puerto Rico. Finally, a spatial extension of this analysis using additional weather stations across the island would also help assess whether the patterns observed at the San Juan International Airport station are consistent regionally.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Note:\n*As a graduate student in Environmental Data Science, my goal in this analysis is not to produce a full atmospheric attribution study, but to demonstrate how statistical tools can be applied to explore relationships between climate indices and extreme precipitation. ENSO, NAO, and Tropical North Atlantic SSTs were selected because they are widely used indicators of large-scale climate variability, and their definitions are well documented in NOAA datasets. While I am not an atmospheric scientist, the purpose of this model is to illustrate how these indices can be incorporated into a statistical framework, interpreted, and contextualized within broader climate processes. The results therefore reflect an introductory, data-driven perspective rather than a definitive climatological explanation.*\n:::\n\n# Data Sources\n\n## Monthly NAO Indices\n\nThe NAO describes fluctuations in the pressure gradient between the Azores High and Icelandic Low. Positive NAO phases are associated with enhanced westerlies and changes in North Atlantic storm patterns, which can influence large-scale moisture transport. \nhttps://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/wd52dg/data/indices/nao_index.tim\n\n# References\n",
