As shown in U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) climatological analyses (Figure 1), pronounced orographic effects from the Cordillera Central and Sierra de Cayey create substantial spatial variability in rainfall. Trade winds carrying moisture rise along the northern windward slopes and result in the production of high precipitation totals north of the hydrologic divide, while the southern coastal plain lies within a rain shadow, resulting in considerably lower annual rainfall (USGS, 2016).\n\nGlobally, these local precipitation dynamics occur against the backdrop of broader changes in the hydrological cycle. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2023) reports that globally averaged precipitation over land has likely increased since 1950, with the rate of increase accelerating after the 1980s. Human influence has likely contributed to both observed changes in precipitation patterns. The IPCC also notes that mid-latitude storm tracks have likely shifted poleward since the 1980s and affected large-scale circulation patterns that interact with tropical moisture and storm systems.\n\nUnderstanding intensity of rainfall events also requires a clear definition of what constitutes an “extreme event.” According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, 2020), an extreme event occurs when weather or climate conditions fall near the upper or lower ends of the historical range. Although thresholds vary, scientists often classify extremes as events in the top 5–10% of historical measurements. This percentile-based definition allows for meaningful comparisons over time even as climate baselines shift.\n\nTogether, these drivers provide context for evaluating long-term changes in extreme rainfall at the San Juan Airport station. In a humid tropical island setting where orographic lifting, ocean–atmosphere interactions, and global climate variability shape precipitation, it is meaningful for climate resilience planning to assess whether extreme rainfall events have become more frequent. Motivated by these factors, this study investigates the following question: **Have extreme precipitation events increased in Puerto Rico over the past 50 years?**\n\n![Distribution of Mean Annual Precipitation in Puerto Rico](C:/Documents/MEDS/Portfolio/mmorenorolon.github.io/posts/2025-12-02-climate-variability/usgs_annual_precip_map.jpg)\n\nTo explore this question, I analyzed 50 years of daily precipitation data from NOAA’s weather station at the San Juan International Airport. I calculated the number of extreme precipitation events per year, using a threshold of X mm. Then I used a Negative Binomial model, which is well-suited for count data that show more variation than what a Poisson model can comfortably handle.\n\nMy goal is simple:\nIs San Juan experiencing more extreme rainfall events now compared to the 1970s?\n\nIf so, how much of this change can be explained by broader climate patterns like El Niño (ENSO) or changes in sea surface temperature (SST)?\n\n# Data Sources\n\nThis analysis uses three publicly available NOAA datasets:\nDaily precipitation from the San Juan International Airport (1975–2024).\n\nENSO index (Niño 3.4 anomaly), a measure of El Niño / La Niña conditions.\n\nSea surface temperature (SST) near Puerto Rico, extracted from NOAA’s ERSSTv5 dataset.\n\nI aggregated the daily rainfall dataset into yearly counts of extreme precipitation events, defined as days where rainfall exceeded the 95th percentile threshold. I then merged these yearly counts with yearly averages of ENSO and SST.\n\n# Why a Negative Binomial Model?\nThe response variable in this project is the number of extreme precipitation events per year. This is a form of count data, and the simplest model for counts is the Poisson model. However, the Poisson model assumes that the mean and variance of the data are equal. That is not true for precipitation extremes.\n\nSome years have many extreme events, while other years have very few, leading to overdispersion—the variance exceeds the mean. The Negative Binomial model adds an extra dispersion parameter that relaxes the strict Poisson assumption, making it a better fit for environmental count data.\nThis is especially important for events like extreme rainfall, which are influenced by seasonal cycles, climate modes, and storm activity.\n\n# DAG\n\nTo clarify the relationships among variables, I constructed a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this framework, Year captures long-term climate trends, ENSO represents natural climate variability, and SST captures local ocean warming. All three variables can influence the number of extreme precipitation events in San Juan.\n\nIn the DAG, Year and ENSO both influence SST, and SST directly influences the expected number of extreme rainfall events. Year may also have a direct effect on extreme rainfall—for example, due to long-term climate change or changes in storm frequency. This DAG helped guide the specification of the statistical model and ensures that I only include predictors with a plausible physical rationale.\n\n# Statistical Model\n\n$$\nY_t \\sim \\text{NegativeBinomial}(\\mu_t, \\theta)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\log(\\mu_t) = \n\\beta_0 \n+ \\beta_1\\,\\text{Year}_t\n+ \\beta_2\\,\\text{ENSO}_t\n+ \\beta_3\\,\\text{SST}_t\n+ \\beta_4\\,\\text{NAO}_t\n$$\nWhere:\n$Y_t$ is the expected number of extreme events\n\n\n$\\beta_0$ is the dispersion parameter\n\n\n$\\beta_1$ captures long-term trends\n\n\n$\\beta_2$ captures ENSO-related variability\n\n\n$\\beta_3$ captures the role of ocean temperatures in generating moisture for heavy rainfall\n\n$\\beta_4$ captures NAO-related variability\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# read_csv(\"data/sju_ncei_data.csv\") %>%\n#   mutate(date = ymd(date),\n#          year = year(date)) %>%\n#   filter(!is.na(prcp))\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Data Simulation\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(123)\n\n# create year variable\nyears <- 1950:2025\nn <- length(years)\nyear_centered <- years - mean(years)\n\n# generate predictor's index values\nnao <- rnorm(n, 0, 1)\nenso <- rnorm(n, 0, 1)\nsst <- rnorm(n, 0, 1)\n\n# true parameter coefficients\nbeta0 <- 2\nbeta1 <- -0.3\nbeta2 <- 0.2\nbeta3 <- 0.1\nbeta4 <- 0.01\n\n# create the linear predictor\neta <- beta0 + beta1*nao + beta2*enso + beta3*sst + beta4*year_centered\n\n# mean response\nmu <- exp(eta)\n\n# simulate negative binomial distribution of counts for the response var\nextreme_events <- rnbinom(n, size = 3, mu = mu)\n\n# create the dataframe\nsim_data <- tibble::tibble(extreme_events, \n                   nao, \n                   enso, \n                   sst, \n                   year = years,\n                   year_centered)\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
