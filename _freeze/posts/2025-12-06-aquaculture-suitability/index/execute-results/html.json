Marine aquaculture offers a promising solution, providing a sustainable alternative that can relieve pressure on wild stocks while supporting economic development. According to Gentry et al. (2017), the availability of suitable ocean space is unlikely to limit the expansion of marine aquaculture, indicating that many regions have the physical capacity to support future growth. This presents an important opportunity for countries such as the United States to develop aquaculture systems that meet both economic and environmental objectives. Thus, the central objective of this project is to identify which areas along the U.S. West Coast meet the environmental conditions necessary to support sustainable aquaculture development.\n\nIdentifying where aquaculture can be responsibly developed requires evaluating the environmental conditions that support healthy growth and minimize ecological impacts. This project assesses the suitability of West Coast Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), defined as marine areas extending up to 200 nautical miles from the U.S. coastline where the United States has jurisdiction over natural resource use (NOAA, 2024), for marine aquaculture using two key environmental constraints: sea surface temperature (SST) and bathymetry. Using satellite-derived SST data from 2008–2012 and a regional bathymetry dataset, the total area within each EEZ that meets species-specific environmental thresholds can be quantified. The analysis focuses on two groups: oysters, which are already widely cultivated in California, and the Purple Hinged Rock Scallop (*Crassadoma gigantea*), a giant scallop species with emerging aquaculture potential (Culver et al., 2022). By integrating spatial environmental data with habitat requirements, this project identifies where conditions are most favorable for expanding sustainable marine aquaculture along the U.S. West Coast.\n\n# Methods\n\nTo assess aquaculture suitability along the U.S. West Coast, a generalized function was implemented that automates the processing of sea surface temperature (SST), bathymetry, and EEZ boundary data. Depth requirements for the purple-hinged rock scallop (*Crassadoma gigantea*) were obtained from SeaLifeBase, which reports an ecological depth range of 0–80 m below sea level (b.s.l.) (University of British Columbia, 2025; Harbo, 1997). Thermal tolerance data for this species are not provided in SeaLifeBase, so temperature thresholds were derived from Reef Life Survey observations, which indicate a temperature range of approximately 13.3–22.1 degrees Celsius (Schmid, 2025). In addition, suitability thresholds for oysters were incorporated based on published ecological ranges, with optimal SST values between 11–30 degrees Celsius and depth values between 0 and 70 meters b.s.l. These values were used to define species-specific suitability thresholds for reclassification of SST and bathymetry data. The workflow consisted of four phases. \n\n## 1. Sea Surface Temperature Processing\n\nDaily 5-km SST averages from 2008–2012 were compiled and converted into a single long-term mean SST raster. The datasets were first stacked and then averaged by pixel. SST values, originally in Kelvin, were converted to degrees Celsius. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load and process SST\nSST_2008 <- rast(here('data', 'average_annual_sst_2008.tif'))\nSST_2009 <- rast(here('data', 'average_annual_sst_2009.tif'))\nSST_2010 <- rast(here('data', 'average_annual_sst_2010.tif'))\nSST_2011 <- rast(here('data', 'average_annual_sst_2011.tif'))\nSST_2012 <- rast(here('data', 'average_annual_sst_2012.tif'))\n\n# Check that all SST rasters share the same CRS\nif (crs(SST_2008) == crs(SST_2009) & \n    crs(SST_2009) == crs(SST_2010) & \n    crs(SST_2010) == crs(SST_2011)& \n    crs(SST_2011) == crs(SST_2012)) {\n  print(\"All coordinate reference systems match!\")\n} else {\n  warning(\"Coordinate reference systems do not match!\")\n}\n\n# Stack SST rasters (2008–2012)\n\nsst_stack <- c(SST_2008, SST_2009, SST_2010, SST_2011, SST_2012)\n\n# Check that rasters were stacked successfully\nif (!nlyr(sst_stack) > 0) {\n     message(\"SST stack failed: no raster layers detected.\")\n     stop(\"Halting execution.\")\n}\n\n# Compute mean SST over time (per pixel)\n\nmean_sst <- terra::mean(sst_stack)\n\n# Convert temperature units from Kelvin to Celsius\n\nmean_sst_c <- mean_sst - 273.15\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 2. Bathymetry Processing\n\nA regional depth raster was reprojected to match the SST coordinate reference system (CRS). The bathymetry was cropped to the spatial extent of the SST data and resampled to its resolution to maintain consistency and cell alignment between rasters. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Prepare bathymetry (depth) raster\n\n  # Load the bathymetry raster\nbathy <- rast(here(\"data\", \"depth.tif\"))\n\n# Make CRS match SST:\n  \nbathy_proj <- project(bathy, crs(mean_sst_c))\n\n# Check that the re-projection of the depth raster was successful\ntest_that(\"Bathymetry CRS matches SST CRS after projection\", {\n  expect_identical(crs(bathy_proj), crs(mean_sst_c))\n})\n\n# Crop bathymetry to SST's extent\n  \nbathy_crop <- crop(bathy_proj, mean_sst_c)\n\n# Check resolution of depth vs sst data\nif (xres(bathy_crop) == xres(mean_sst_c) &\n    (yres(bathy_crop) == yres(mean_sst_c))) {\n  print(\"Raster resolutions match!\")\n} else {\n  warning(\"Raster resolutions do not match.\")\n}\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Raster resolutions do not match.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Resample bathymetry to SST resolution (so each cell lines up):\n  \ndepth_res <- resample(bathy_crop, mean_sst_c, method = \"near\")\n\n# Check that the depth and SST match in resolution\ntest_that(\"Depth raster was resampled to match SST resolution\", {\n  expect_equal(res(depth_res), res(mean_sst_c))\n})\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## 3. Environmental Suitability Classification\n\nSpecies-specific temperature and depth constraints were translated into binary suitability surfaces. For the purple-hinged rock scallop (*Crassadoma gigantea*), SST values between 13.3–22.1 Celsius and depths between 0–80 meters b.s.l. were classified as suitable (value = 1), with all other values set to unsuitable (value = 0). In contrast, for oysters, suitability was defined by a broader SST range of 11–30 degrees Celsius and shallower depths between 0 and 70 meters b.s.l. Separate binary rasters were generated for each species, and suitability layers were multiplied to produce combined indices identifying locations that simultaneously satisfied both environmental conditions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Reclassify SST into suitable / unsuitable\n# The oyster thresholds for SST are between 11–30 Celsius\n    \nsst_rcl <- matrix(c(-Inf, 11,  0,\n                      11, 30,  1,\n                      30, Inf, 0), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\nsst_suit <- classify(mean_sst_c, rcl = sst_rcl)\n  \n  \n# Reclassify depth into suitable or unsuitable (1, 0)\n# The depth thresholds for oysters range is 0-70 meters b.s.l.\n    \ndepth_rcl <- matrix(c(-Inf, -70, 0,\n                         -70, 0, 1,\n                         0, Inf, 0), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n  \ndepth_suit <- classify(depth_res, depth_rcl)\n  \n# Combine SST and depth suitability\n  \n# Unit test for sst and depth CRS\ntest_that(\"Reclassified rasters share identical CRS\", {\n  expect_identical(crs(sst_suit), crs(depth_suit))\n})\n\n# Multiply to get 1 only where both are suitable\nsuitability <- sst_suit * depth_suit # 1 = suitable, 0 = unsuitable\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## 4. Suitability Estimation at the EEZ Level\n\nExclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) boundaries were transformed to match the SST projection. The combined suitability raster was masked to the extent of each EEZ, and the area of each raster cell was computed in square kilometers. Suitable cell areas were aggregated within each EEZ to obtain total suitable area per region. These results were subsequently merged with the EEZ polygon dataset and visualized using a colorblind-friendly continuous color scale.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Prepare EEZ vector and mask\neez_sf <- st_read(here(\"data\", \"wc_regions_clean.shp\"), quiet = TRUE)\n\n# convert to SpatVector format\neez <- vect(eez_sf)\n\n# Re-project with mean sst's CRS\neez_proj <- project(eez, mean_sst_c)\n\n# Check that the re-projection of the EEZ shapefile was successful\ntest_that(\"Bathymetry CRS matches SST CRS after projection\", {\n  expect_identical(crs(eez_proj), crs(mean_sst_c))\n  })\n  \n# Mask suitability by EEZ\nsuitability_eez <- mask(suitability, eez_proj)\n  \n# Count suitable cells per EEZ\n  \n# a.

For oysters, Central California and Southern California contained the largest suitable areas, with approximately 4,070 squared km and 3,757 squared km respectively, followed by Washington (2,378 squared km) and Oregon (1,074 squared km). Northern California showed a more limited suitable habitat (178 squared km). In contrast, suitable areas for purple-hinged rock scallops were highly concentrated in the southern portion of the study region. Southern California accounted for nearly all suitable habitat (3,567 squared km), with a small area in Central California (119 km²), while Oregon, Washington, and Northern California contained no suitable area based on the species’ temperature and depth thresholds.\n\n# Discussion\nThe results directly address the project objective of identifying where environmental conditions along the U.S. West Coast support sustainable marine aquaculture development. The spatial differences in aquaculture suitability among oysters and scallops reflect how environmental constraints, namely sea surface temperature and bathymetry, shape the feasibility of expanding aquaculture across Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). \n\nOyster suitability was broadly distributed across the West Coast, with the greatest concentrations being in Central and Southern California. These regions offer both the depth and thermal ranges that align with oyster tolerance, which resulted in several thousand square kilometers of potentially viable habitat. Washington and Oregon also contained meaningful amounts of suitable area, although to a lesser extent. The distribution pattern suggests that oyster aquaculture has relatively flexible environmental requirements within this coastline. This widespread distribution supports prior findings that physical ocean space is unlikely to limit aquaculture expansion (Gentry et al., 2017) and suggests that oysters represent a species with strong potential to contribute to meeting growing seafood demand while alleviating pressure on wild fisheries.\n\nIn contrast, the distribution of suitable habitat for purple-hinged rock scallops was highly geographically restricted. Southern California dominated the available area, as it contributed to nearly all suitable habitat identified in the study, with only a small area in Central California meeting threshold conditions. The absence of suitable areas in Oregon, Washington, and Northern California indicates that the species’ temperature range limits its potential along the cooler northern waters. These results align with the species’ known geographic distribution, as purple-hinged rock scallops are more frequently associated with subtidal, subtropical environments (Culver et al., 2022).\n\nThe stark contrast between the two species underscores the importance of evaluating on a species-specific level and considering their environmental thresholds when evaluating aquaculture potential. While oysters exhibit broad tolerance across the West Coast that enables aquaculture development across multiple EEZs, the purple-hinged rock scallop is limited to a much smaller geographic range despite being native to the region. From a planning perspective, this means that opportunities to expand scallop aquaculture are highly geographically concentrated, while oyster aquaculture can be distributed more widely. Further research is needed to translate these metrics into practical site selection, like evaluating regulatory conditions, ecological interactions, and infrastructure considerations. Nonetheless, by identifying where environmental conditions are most favorable, this study provides a necessary first step toward supporting sustainable marine aquaculture development along the U.S. West Coast.\n\n# References\n\nCulver, C., Jackson, M., Davis, J., Vadopalas, B., Bills, M., Olin, P., & CENTER, W.
