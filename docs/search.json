    "title": "Temporal Trends in the Frequency of Extreme Precipitation Events at San Juan Int’l Airport, Puerto Rico",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Figure 1. Distribution of Mean Annual Precipitation in Puerto Rico\n\n\nPrecipitation patterns in Puerto Rico are shaped by a combination of tropical atmospheric processes and topographic influences. As shown in U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) climatological analyses (Figure 1), pronounced orographic effects from the Cordillera Central and Sierra de Cayey create substantial spatial variability in rainfall. Trade winds carrying moisture rise along the northern windward slopes and result in the production of high precipitation totals north of the hydrologic divide, while the southern coastal plain lies within a rain shadow, resulting in considerably lower annual rainfall (USGS, 2016).\nGlobally, these local precipitation dynamics occur against the backdrop of broader changes in the hydrological cycle. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2023) reports that globally averaged precipitation over land has likely increased since 1950, with the rate of increase accelerating after the 1980s. Human influence has likely contributed to both observed changes in precipitation patterns. The IPCC also notes that mid-latitude storm tracks have likely shifted poleward since the 1980s and affected large-scale circulation patterns that interact with tropical moisture and storm systems.\nUnderstanding intensity of rainfall events also requires a clear definition of what constitutes an “extreme event.” According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, 2020), an extreme event occurs when weather or climate conditions fall near the upper or lower ends of the historical range. Although thresholds vary, scientists often classify extremes as events in the top 5–10% of historical measurements. This percentile-based definition allows for meaningful comparisons over time even as climate baselines shift.\nTogether, these drivers provide context for evaluating long-term changes in extreme rainfall at the San Juan Airport station. In a humid tropical island setting where orographic lifting, ocean–atmosphere interactions, and global climate variability shape precipitation, it is meaningful for climate resilience planning to assess whether extreme rainfall events have become more frequent. Motivated by these factors, this study investigates the following question: Have extreme precipitation events increased in Puerto Rico over the past 50 years?\nTo explore this question, I analyzed 50 years of daily precipitation data from NOAA’s weather station at the San Juan International Airport. I calculated the number of extreme precipitation events per year, using a threshold of X mm. Then I used a Negative Binomial model, which is well-suited for count data that show more variation than what a Poisson model can comfortably handle.\nMy goal is simple: Is San Juan experiencing more extreme rainfall events now compared to the 1970s?\nIf so, how much of this change can be explained by broader climate patterns like El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), or changes in sea surface temperature (SST)?"

First, using Landsat 8 false-color imagery, the analysis visualizes burn scars by assigning infrared bands to visible colors to highlight burn severity and the spatial extent of the damage. Second, it examines the social dimensions of these wildfires by integrating Environmental Justice Index (EJI) data with the fire perimeters. Together, these methods show how geospatial data science can reveal not only the ecological effects of wildfire but also the uneven social landscape in which these fires occur."

Confirmed consistency in CRS and prepared the data layers for spatial analysis and satellite overlay.\n\nSatellite Imagery Handling & False-Color Composites\n\nLoaded Landsat 8 surface reflectance data with xarray, restored missing CRS information using rioxarray. I created both true-color (RGB) and false-color (SWIR–NIR–Red) composites using matplotlib to highlight burn scars and vegetation loss.\n\nEnvironmental Justice Analysis\n\nImported California Environmental Justice Index (EJI) data to perform spatial joins and clip operations with geopandas. I used pandas to isolate for the social-vulnerability variable of interest (E_DISABL) which represents the percent of residents with a disability.\n\nGeospatial Visualization for Community Impact Assessment\n\nCombined the fire perimeters, satellite imagery, and EJI demographic data into comparative maps using matplotlib and contextily to reveal how wildfire footprints intersect with socially vulnerable communities in Los Angeles County.\n\nAbout the Data: Datasets Description\n\nLandsat Data:\nThe NetCDF dataset landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc contains atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data from the Landsat 8 satellite, published on February 23, 2025 through the Microsoft Planetary Computer. It includes key spectral bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared) clipped to the perimeters of the Eaton and Palisades Fires in Los Angeles County. The dataset stores geospatial metadata in the spatial_ref variable. With a spatial resolution of 30 meters, this dataset supports the creation of true color and false color composites to assess vegetation health, burn severity and the extent of fire scars. Date Accessed: 11/19/2025\n\n\nFire Perimeter Data:\nThe Palisades and Eaton Dissolved Fire Perimeters (2025) dataset, published on January 21, 2025 by the County of Los Angeles, provides dissolved boundary polygons for the Eaton and Palisades Fires. Derived from the NIFC FIRIS fire service, which originally contained daily perimeter snapshots, the boundaries were merged to create a single burn perimeter for each fire. One Eaton record (mission 2025-CALAC-009087) was excluded because buffered “destroyed” points did not reliably represent burned areas. The dataset is hosted on ArcGIS Hub and includes geospatial layers for both fire perimeters, which supports wildfire impact analysis, mapping and environmental monitoring. Date Accessed: 11/19/2025\n\n\nEnvironmental Justice Index Data:\nThe Environmental Justice Index (EJI) dataset provides census-tract-level indicators that capture the social and demographic conditions shaping a community’s ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from environmental hazards. The dataset includes variables related to socioeconomic status, housing and transportation, health vulnerability, and population characteristics. For this analysis, we downloaded the EJI data for California in 2024. Date Accessed: 11/21/2025\n\n# Import libraries\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport xarray as xr\nimport rioxarray as rio\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport pandas as pd\nimport contextily as ctx\n\nIn this step, we loaded the Python packages used throughout the notebook. These libraries provide tools for working with geospatial raster and vector data, plotting imagery, handling coordinate reference systems (CRS), and managing arrays and tables. This foundation is necessary before reading the fire perimeter shapefiles and Landsat NetCDF imagery.\n\n\n2.

Clean column names reduce ambiguity and improve readability in subsequent analyses.\n\n# Simplify the geodataframe columns\nfires.columns = (\n    fires.columns\n    .str.strip()          # remove leading or trailing spaces\n    .str.lower()          # convert to lowercase\n    .str.replace(\"__\", \"_\")  # replace double underscores with single\n)\n\n# View the simplified geodataframe columns\nfires.columns\n\nIndex(['objectid', 'type', 'shape_are', 'shape_len', 'geometry'], dtype='object')\n\n\n\n# Rename the `shape_are` and `shape_len` columns\nfires= fires.rename(columns={\n    \"shape_are\": \"area\",\n    \"shape_len\": \"length\"\n})\n\n# View the dataframe with the renamed columns\nfires.columns\n\nIndex(['objectid', 'type', 'area', 'length', 'geometry'], dtype='object')\n\n\n\n\n3. NetCDF data import and exploration\n\nLoading the Landsat 8 Bands\nHere, we load the individual spectral bands from the Landsat 8 dataset. Each band represents reflectance in a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because false color imagery relies on assigning SWIR, NIR, and Red bands to visible colors, loading these bands correctly is essential for constructing the final composite.\n\n# Read in Landsat 8 data\nlandsat8 = xr.open_dataset('data/landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc')\n\n\n\nQuick Band Visualization\nPlotting a single band provides an initial visual check and helps confirm that the dataset was read correctly. This is a useful diagnostic step before building composite imagery.\n\n# Quick visualization of the red band of the dataset\nlandsat8['red'].plot()\n\n\n\nSummary of Preliminary Exploration for landsat8\nThe dataset shows that the blue band contains 109 missing values, while the green band has only one; all other variables are complete with no missing data. The spatial dimensions are 1418 y‑coordinates by 2742 x‑coordinates. Band values are stored as integers, whereas the time variable is in datetime format. All measurements are expressed in meters, and the dataset is referenced to CRS EPSG:32611.\n\n\n\n4. Restoring Geospatial Information\n\n# Print the CRS of `landsat8` with `rio.crs`\nprint(landsat8.rio.crs)\n\n\n# Print the CRS by using accesing the spatial_ref.crs_wkt attribute of the dataset\nlandsat8.spatial_ref.crs_wkt\n\n\nRestoring Missing Spatial Reference Information\nAlthough the Landsat NetCDF file contains a spatial_ref variable, the CRS is not automatically recognized by rioxarray.\nHere we extract the WKT-formatted CRS stored inside spatial_ref and write it back to the dataset using .rio.write_crs().\nThis step is essential for aligning the raster dataset with the fire perimeter polygons.\n\n# Recover the geospatial information and the spatial reference information \nlandsat8.rio.write_crs('EPSG:32611', inplace=True)\n\n# Print the CRS of the updated dataset\nprint(landsat8.rio.crs)\n\nEPSG:32611\n\n\n\n\n\n5. True Color Image\n\nCreating a True Color Image\nTo generate a natural-looking image of the landscape, we combine the red, green, and blue bands.\nBecause clouds and bright targets can skew pixel values, we use the robust=True parameter to rescale the display range and improve visualization. We also address missing values by replacing NaNs with zeros to avoid rendering warnings.\n\n# c. Identify which bands have missing values \nlandsat8.isnull().sum()\n\nThe green and blue bands have missing values.\n\n# d. Substitute any missing values in the dataset with zeroes\nlandsat8_filled = landsat8.fillna(0)\n\n\n# e. Create a true color image without warnings\nlandsat8_filled[['red','green','blue']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue Color Image Generation Takeaways\nBecause clouds are extremely bright, they can stretch the scale, so the non-cloud pixels are squeezed into a tiny part of the range. As a result, the entire image could look blank. However, after setting the robust parameter to ‘True’, this tells xarray to ignore the extreme outliers. This fixed the first warning. To identify which bands contain missing values, I used landsat8.isnull().sum(), which counts the number of missing pixels in each data variable. This revealed that the green and blue bands included NaN values. I applied fillna(0) to the dataset and then generated the true color image using the filled data. This ensured that the image plotted without warnings.\n\n\n\n6. False Color Image\n\n\nCreating the False Color Composite\nTo highlight burn scars and vegetation health, we combine three Landsat bands into a false color image: - SWIR → Red channel - NIR → Green channel - Red → Blue channel\nThis band arrangement enhances the visibility of burned regions and stressed vegetation. This visualization will make it easier to interpret fire impacts across the Palisades and Eaton areas.\n\n# Plot the short-wave infrared (swir22), near-infrared, and red variables (in that order)\nlandsat8_filled[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Map\n\n\nReprojecting Raster and Vector Data\nThe Landsat imagery and fire perimeter shapefiles may use different coordinate reference systems (CRS).\nTo properly overlay perimeter polygons on the raster data, we reproject both datasets into a common CRS.\nThis ensures that pixel locations align with fire boundaries on the map.\n\n# Verify that CRS's match\nfires.crs == landsat8_filled.rio.crs\n\n\n# Reproject the `fires` polygons to the landsat dataset\nfires = fires.to_crs(landsat8_filled.rio.crs)\n\n\n# Check that the CRS's match after reprojection\nfires.crs == landsat8.rio.crs\n\n\nprint(fires.total_bounds)\n\n\nMapping Fire Perimeters on the False Color Composite\nIn this final visualization, we overlay the Eaton and Palisades fire boundaries on the false color image.\nThis map reveals which areas exhibit increased SWIR reflectance, which is a strong indicator of recent burns, and confirms alignment with official fire perimeters. Text annotations help distinguish each fire footprint.\n\n# Create empty plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(11,5))\nax.axis('off')\n\n# Show the shortwave infrared/near-infrared/red false color image together with both fire perimeters\nlandsat8_filled[['swir22', 'nir08', 'red']].to_array().plot.imshow(robust=True, ax = ax)\nfires.plot(ax=ax, \n           legend=True,\n           color = 'none',\n           edgecolor='red')\n\n# Add a title\nax.set_title(\"False Color Composite Mapping of the Palisades and Eaton Fire Perimeters\", fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')\n\n# Add text annotation for the Eaton Fire\nax.text(0.85, 0.5, \"Eaton Fire\",\n        transform=ax.transAxes,  # relative to axes (0–1)\n        ha=\"right\", va=\"bottom\",\n        fontsize=12, bbox=dict(facecolor=\"white\", alpha=0.6))\n\n# Add text annotation for the Palisades Fire\nax.text(0.35, 0.55, \"Palisades Fire\",\n        transform=ax.transAxes,  # relative to axes (0–1)\n        ha=\"right\", va=\"bottom\",\n        fontsize=12, bbox=dict(facecolor=\"white\", alpha=0.6))\n\n# Display plot\nplt.show()\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 640x480 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\nMore About the Use of False Color Imagery in this Figure\nThe image above used the shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red band combination, which highlights the visibility of burned areas and stress on vegetation. In this false color scheme, healthy vegeation appears in bright green In this combination, shortwave infrared (SWIR) is assigned to the red display channel, near-infrared (NIR) to green, and red light to blue. Burn scars appear in deep red tones, while SWIR reflectance increases after vegetation burns due to the loss of water content and exposure of burned soil. Vegetation reflects strongly in the NIR, which is mapped to the green channel in this composite, while Urban areas and developed land appear in shades of cyan or gray. Water appears very dark or black because both SWIR and NIR are almost completely absorbed by water. These spectral relationships allow the burned areas from the Palisades and Eaton fires to stand out strongly against the surrounding landscape. The fire perimeters (shown as transparent red polygons) align with the regions of intense SWIR reflectance. This map confirms the extent of the burn scars captured by Landsat."
