    "section": "",
    "text": "Figure 1. Distribution of Mean Annual Precipitation in Puerto Rico\n\n\nPrecipitation patterns in Puerto Rico are shaped by a combination of tropical atmospheric processes and topographic influences. As shown in U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) climatological analyses (Figure 1), pronounced orographic effects from the Cordillera Central and Sierra de Cayey create substantial spatial variability in rainfall. Trade winds carrying moisture rise along the northern windward slopes and result in the production of high precipitation totals north of the hydrologic divide, while the southern coastal plain lies within a rain shadow, resulting in considerably lower annual rainfall (USGS, 2016).\nGlobally, these local precipitation dynamics occur against the backdrop of broader changes in the hydrological cycle. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2023) reports that globally averaged precipitation over land has likely increased since 1950, with the rate of increase accelerating after the 1980s. Human influence has likely contributed to both observed changes in precipitation patterns. The IPCC also notes that mid-latitude storm tracks have likely shifted poleward since the 1980s and affected large-scale circulation patterns that interact with tropical moisture and storm systems.\nUnderstanding intensity of rainfall events also requires a clear definition of what constitutes an “extreme event.” According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, 2020), an extreme event occurs when weather or climate conditions fall near the upper or lower ends of the historical range. Although thresholds vary, scientists often classify extremes as events in the top 5–10% of historical measurements. This percentile-based definition allows for meaningful comparisons over time even as climate baselines shift.\nTogether, these drivers provide context for evaluating long-term changes in extreme rainfall at the San Juan Airport station. In a humid tropical island setting where orographic lifting, ocean–atmosphere interactions, and global climate variability shape precipitation, it is meaningful for climate resilience planning to assess whether extreme rainfall events have become more frequent. Motivated by these factors, this study investigates the following question: Have extreme precipitation events increased in Puerto Rico over the past 50 years?\nTo explore this question, I analyzed 50 years of daily precipitation data from NOAA’s weather station at the San Juan International Airport. I calculated the number of extreme precipitation events per year, using a threshold of 28.45 mm. I used a Negative Binomial model, which is well-suited for count data that show more variation than what a Poisson model can handle.\nMy goal is simple: Is San Juan experiencing more extreme rainfall events now compared to the 1970s?\nIf so, how much of this change can be explained by broader climate patterns like El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), or changes in sea surface temperature (SST)?"

These mismatches occur because the simulated dataset contains only 50 observations (one per year). When true effects are small, limited sample size reduces the model’s ability to recover the exact parameter values even when the model is correctly specified.\nTo determine whether these discrepancies were due to the small sample size, I repeated the simulation using a much larger sample.\n\n\nCode\n#|code-fold: false\n#-------------------- Larger simulation with repeated years --------------------\nset.seed(123)\n\nyears_sim2 &lt;- rep(1975:2025, 1000)\nn_sim2 &lt;- length(years_sim2)\n\n# Center year\nyear_ref_sim2 &lt;- years_sim2 - mean(years_sim2)\n\n# Generate predictors\nnao_sim2  &lt;- rnorm(n_sim2, 0, 1)\nenso_sim2 &lt;- rnorm(n_sim2, 0, 1)\nsst_sim2  &lt;- rnorm(n_sim2, 0, 1)\n\n# True parameters\nbeta0 &lt;- 2.5\nbeta1 &lt;- 0.01\nbeta2 &lt;- 0.05\nbeta3 &lt;- 0.3\nbeta4 &lt;- -0.6\n\n# Linear predictor\nlog_mean_sim2 &lt;- beta0 + beta1*year_ref_sim2 + beta2*enso_sim2 + \n  beta3*sst_sim2 + beta4*nao_sim2\n\nmu_sim2 &lt;- exp(log_mean_sim2)\n\n# Simulated counts\nextreme_events_sim2 &lt;- rnbinom(n_sim2, size = 3, mu = mu_sim2)\n\n# Fit model\nsim2_data &lt;- tibble::tibble(extreme_events = extreme_events_sim2,\n                            year_ref = year_ref_sim2,\n                            enso = enso_sim2,\n                            nao = nao_sim2,\n                            sst = sst_sim2)\n\n# simulate the model\nsim2_nb_model &lt;- glm.nb(extreme_events ~ year_ref + enso + nao + sst, \n                        data = sim2_data)\n\n# format the model summary table\nbroom::tidy(sim2_nb_model) %&gt;%\n  kable(digits = 3, caption = \"Recovered Coefficients from the Large Simulation (n ≈ 50,000)\") %&gt;% \n  kable_paper(\"hover\", full_width = FALSE)\n\n\n\nRecovered Coefficients from the Large Simulation (n ≈ 50,000)\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n2.496\n0.003\n849.633\n0\n\n\nyear_ref\n0.010\n0.000\n51.878\n0\n\n\nenso\n0.049\n0.003\n16.950\n0\n\n\nnao\n-0.600\n0.003\n-201.078\n0\n\n\nsst\n0.303\n0.003\n103.899\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a much larger simulated dataset (approximately 50,000 observations), the fitted model recovers the true parameter values with near-perfect accuracy. This confirms that the mismatches observed earlier were due to limited sample size rather than deficiencies in the model structure. Small effects such as the ENSO coefficient (0.05) are difficult to recover with only 50 years of observations, but are accurately estimated once the sample size is expanded. This larger simulation validates the parameter recovery process and demonstrates that the Negative Binomial model performs as expected under the assumptions used in this analysis.\n\n\nCode\n#|code-fold: true\n#| fig-cap: \"Figure 10.

The background points show the raw simulated data, which vary widely from year to year, while the solid line represents the model’s expected relationship. Because NAO was assigned a negative coefficient in the simulation, the predicted number of extreme events decreases as NAO increases. The shaded band shows the 95% confidence interval around the prediction, which widens toward the edges of the NAO range where fewer observations occur. Overall, this figure demonstrates that the fitted Negative Binomial model captures the general downward trend that was built into the simulated data and behaves in line with the model assumptions."

Source: USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station; Saunders, L. (2025), “Science supports Los Angeles wildfires’ aftermath.”\n\n\nIn early 2025, wildfires burned across Southern California, including the Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles County. This event forced communities to evacuate and caused widespread damage to homes, infrastructure, and natural landscapes. While firefighting efforts eventually contained the flames, the risks associated with these events did not end with fire suppression. According to the USDA Forest Service, burned hillslopes left behind by these fires became highly vulnerable to secondary hazards such as flash flooding, erosion, and mudslides during subsequent rain events. Scientists from the USDA Forest Service’s Rocky Mountain Research Station and interagency response teams deployed post-fire assessment tools to identify areas most at risk and to support mitigation efforts aimed at protecting downstream communities and critical infrastructure (Saunders, 2025).\nThese post-fire risks highlight the importance of understanding not only where wildfires occur, but also how their impacts intersect with the landscapes and communities affected by them. In response to this need, I examined the extent of the damage and social vulnerability wrought by the Eaton and Palisades fires. First, I used Landsat 8 false-color imagery to visualize burn scars by assigning infrared bands to visible colors and allow burn severity and the spatial extent of damage to be clearly identified. Second, my analysis integrates Environmental Justice Index (EJI) data with official fire perimeters to explore the social dimensions of wildfire impacts. Together, these approaches demonstrate how geospatial data science can be used to assess both the physical effects of wildfires and the uneven social conditions that shape community vulnerability and recovery."

    "text": "About the Data: Datasets Description\n\nLandsat Data:\nThe NetCDF dataset landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc contains atmospherically corrected surface reflectance data from the Landsat 8 satellite, published on February 23, 2025 through the Microsoft Planetary Computer. It includes key spectral bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared) clipped to the perimeters of the Eaton and Palisades Fires in Los Angeles County. The dataset stores geospatial metadata in the spatial_ref variable. With a spatial resolution of 30 meters, this dataset supports the creation of true color and false color composites to assess vegetation health, burn severity and the extent of fire scars. Date Accessed: 11/19/2025\n\n\nFire Perimeter Data:\nThe Palisades and Eaton Dissolved Fire Perimeters (2025) dataset, published on January 21, 2025 by the County of Los Angeles, provides dissolved boundary polygons for the Eaton and Palisades Fires. Derived from the NIFC FIRIS fire service, which originally contained daily perimeter snapshots, the boundaries were merged to create a single burn perimeter for each fire. One Eaton record (mission 2025-CALAC-009087) was excluded because buffered “destroyed” points did not reliably represent burned areas. The dataset is hosted on ArcGIS Hub and includes geospatial layers for both fire perimeters, which supports wildfire impact analysis, mapping and environmental monitoring. Date Accessed: 11/19/2025\n\n\nEnvironmental Justice Index Data:\nThe Environmental Justice Index (EJI) dataset provides census-tract-level indicators that capture the social and demographic conditions shaping a community’s ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from environmental hazards. The dataset includes variables related to socioeconomic status, housing and transportation, health vulnerability, and population characteristics. For this analysis, we downloaded the EJI data for California in 2024. This analysis also focuses on the variable E_DISABL, which represents the percentage of residents with a disability in each census tract. Date Accessed: 11/21/2025\n\n\nImport Libraries and Data\nI first imported the libraries and loaded the dataframes required to perform the analysis.\n\n# Import libraries\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport xarray as xr\nimport rioxarray as rio\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport pandas as pd\nimport contextily as ctx\nimport matplotlib.patches as mpatches\n\nIn this first step, we loaded the Python packages used throughout the notebook. These libraries provide tools for working with geospatial raster and vector data, plotting imagery, handling coordinate reference systems (CRS), and managing arrays. This foundation is necessary before reading the fire perimeter shapefiles and Landsat NetCDF imagery.\n\n\nFire Perimeter Data Exploration\n\nLoading the Eaton Fire Perimeter\nWe begin by loading the Eaton Fire perimeter shapefile. This allows us to inspect the geometry structure, attribute fields, and CRS. Understanding the perimeter data ensures that it will align properly with the Landsat imagery later in the notebook.\n\n# Read in Eaton fire perimeter data\neaton_fire = gpd.read_file(os.path.join('data','Eaton_Perimeter_20250121','Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.shp'))\n\n# View the first five rows of the `eaton_fire` geodataframe\neaton_fire.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID\ntype\nShape__Are\nShape__Len\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nHeat Perimeter\n2206.265625\n270.199719\nPOLYGON ((-13146936.686 4051222.067, -13146932...\n\n\n1\n2\nHeat Perimeter\n20710.207031\n839.204218\nPOLYGON ((-13150835.463 4052713.929, -13150831...\n\n\n2\n3\nHeat Perimeter\n3639.238281\n250.304502\nPOLYGON ((-13153094.697 4053057.596, -13153113...\n\n\n3\n4\nHeat Perimeter\n1464.550781\n148.106792\nPOLYGON ((-13145097.740 4053118.235, -13145100...\n\n\n4\n5\nHeat Perimeter\n4132.753906\n247.960744\nPOLYGON ((-13153131.126 4053196.882, -13153131...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading the Palisades Fire Perimeter\nNext, we read in the Palisades fire perimeter data.\n\n# Read in Palisades fire perimeter data\npalis_fire = gpd.read_file(os.path.join('data','Palisades_Perimeter_20250121', 'Palisades_Perimeter_20250121.shp'))\n\n# View the first five rows of the palis_fire perimeter geodataframe\npalis_fire.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID\ntype\nShape__Are\nShape__Len\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nHeat Perimeter\n1182.082031\n267.101144\nPOLYGON ((-13193543.302 4032913.077, -13193543...\n\n\n1\n2\nHeat Perimeter\n2222.488281\n185.498783\nPOLYGON ((-13193524.155 4033067.953, -13193524...\n\n\n2\n3\nHeat Perimeter\n21.011719\n22.412814\nPOLYGON ((-13193598.085 4033158.222, -13193598...\n\n\n3\n4\nHeat Perimeter\n214.992188\n76.639180\nPOLYGON ((-13193654.249 4033146.033, -13193656...\n\n\n4\n5\nHeat Perimeter\n44203.453125\n1569.259764\nPOLYGON ((-13194209.580 4033236.320, -13194209...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerging Eaton and Palisades Perimeters\nBecause both perimeter shapefiles share the same CRS and attribute structure, we can safely merge them into one GeoDataFrame.\nThis combined dataset (fires) streamlines visualization and overlay operations later in the notebook. The following code verifies that the CRS’s are the same and share the same columns. In addition, we add a new column to be able to differentiate within our merged geodataframe which geometries correspond to the Palisades and Eaton fire perimeters.\n\n# Check that both geodataframes share the same CRS\nassert eaton_fire.crs == palis_fire.crs\n\n# Add a new column to identify each fire's geometries within the dataframe\neaton_fire['fire_name'] = 'Eaton'\npalis_fire['fire_name'] = 'Palisades'\n\n# Concatenate both geodataframes\nfires = gpd.GeoDataFrame(pd.concat([eaton_fire, palis_fire], ignore_index= True))\n\n# View the first five rows of `fires`\nfires.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTID\ntype\nShape__Are\nShape__Len\ngeometry\nfire_name\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nHeat Perimeter\n2206.265625\n270.199719\nPOLYGON ((-13146936.686 4051222.067, -13146932...\nEaton\n\n\n1\n2\nHeat Perimeter\n20710.207031\n839.204218\nPOLYGON ((-13150835.463 4052713.929, -13150831...\nEaton\n\n\n2\n3\nHeat Perimeter\n3639.238281\n250.304502\nPOLYGON ((-13153094.697 4053057.596, -13153113...\nEaton\n\n\n3\n4\nHeat Perimeter\n1464.550781\n148.106792\nPOLYGON ((-13145097.740 4053118.235, -13145100...\nEaton\n\n\n4\n5\nHeat Perimeter\n4132.753906\n247.960744\nPOLYGON ((-13153131.126 4053196.882, -13153131...\nEaton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleaning Column Names\nTo make the dataset easier to work with, we standardize column names by converting them to lowercase and renaming fields such as shape_are toarea and shape_len to length. Clean column names reduce ambiguity and improve readability in subsequent analyses.\n\n# Simplify the geodataframe columns\nfires.columns = (\n    fires.columns\n    .str.strip()          # Remove leading or trailing spaces\n    .str.lower()          # Convert to lowercase\n    .str.replace(\"__\", \"_\")  # Replace double underscores with single\n)\n\n# View the simplified geodataframe columns\nfires.columns\n\nIndex(['objectid', 'type', 'shape_are', 'shape_len', 'geometry'], dtype='object')\n\n\nAfter cleaning the column names, I renamed shape_are and shape_len to area and length, respectively, to improve readability and ensure the column names were more easily interpretable throughout the analysis.\n\n# Rename the `shape_are` and `shape_len` columns\nfires= fires.rename(columns={\n    \"shape_are\": \"area\",\n    \"shape_len\": \"length\"\n})\n\n# View the dataframe with the renamed columns\nfires.columns\n\nIndex(['objectid', 'type', 'area', 'length', 'geometry'], dtype='object')\n\n\nNow that the fire perimeter data have been imported, merged, and cleaned, we can proceed to preprocess the Landsat NetCDF dataset.\n\n\nNetCDF data import and exploration\n\nLoading the Landsat 8 Bands\nAfter processing the fire perimeter data, I proceeded to load the individual spectral bands from the Landsat 8 dataset. Each band represents reflectance in a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Setting the robust=True parameter instructs xarray to ignore extreme outliers, which resolves this issue and allows surface features to become visible. To further assess data quality, I used landsat8.isnull().sum() to identify missing values across spectral bands and revealed that there were NaN values in the green and blue bands. These missing values were addressed by applying fillna(0) prior to generating the true-color image.\nWhile the true-color composite provides a realistic view of the landscape, it can still obscure burn scars and vegetation stress, particularly in complex post-fire environments. For this reason, we create a false-color composite, which leverages infrared bands to more effectively distinguish burned areas and variations in vegetation health."

In this false color scheme, healthy vegetation appears in bright green In this combination, shortwave infrared (SWIR) is assigned to the red display channel, near-infrared (NIR) to green, and red light to blue. Burn scars appear in deep red tones, while SWIR reflectance increases after vegetation burns due to the loss of water content and exposure of burned soil. Vegetation reflects strongly in the NIR, which is mapped to the green channel in this composite, while Urban areas and developed land appear in shades of cyan or gray. Water appears very dark or black because both SWIR and NIR are almost completely absorbed by water. These spectral relationships allow the burned areas from the Palisades and Eaton fires to stand out strongly against the surrounding landscape. The fire perimeters (shown as transparent red polygons) align with the regions of intense SWIR reflectance. This map confirms the extent of the burn scars captured by Landsat.\nWhile false-color imagery is effective for identifying the spatial extent and severity of wildfire damage, it captures only the physical impacts on the landscape. To fully understand the consequences of the Eaton and Palisades fires, it is also necessary to examine how these burned areas intersect with nearby communities and their social characteristics. In the next section, the analysis shifts from satellite-based burn mapping to a social vulnerability perspective by integrating Environmental Justice Index (EJI) data with the fire perimeters to explore how wildfire exposure overlaps with populations that may face additional challenges during response and recovery."

    "text": "Social dimensions of the Eaton and Palisades Fires\nWildfires do not impact all communities equally. Beyond the physical footprint of a burn scar, the social and demographic characteristics of nearby neighborhoods play a crucial role in shaping how residents experience, respond to, and recover from wildfire events. In this section, I explore the social dimensions of the Eaton and Palisades Fires by integrating census-tract–level indicators from the Environmental Justice Index (EJI) with each fire’s geographic perimeter.\n\nImporting EJI Data\nFirst, the data were imported and the Palisades and Eaton fire polygons were reprojected to a common coordinate reference system (CRS) before performing the spatial join.\n\n# Read in the EJI dataset\nca_eji_fp = os.path.join('data','EJI_2024_California_GDB/EJI_2024_California/EJI_2024_California.gdb')\nca_eji = gpd.read_file(ca_eji_fp)\n\n\n# Reproject all datasets to the same crs\npalis_fire = palis_fire.to_crs(ca_eji.crs)\neaton_fire = eaton_fire.to_crs(ca_eji.crs)\n\nThe purpose of the spatial join is to identify which Environmental Justice Index (EJI) census tracts intersect the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters. By retaining only the census tracts that spatially overlap the fire boundaries, the spatial join links geographic exposure to wildfire with tract-level social and demographic attributes. This step allows the analysis to focus specifically on communities that were directly affected by the fires.\n\n# Get the EJI tracts intersecting the palisades fire perimeter\neji_palisades_join = gpd.sjoin(ca_eji, palis_fire, how='inner', predicate='intersects')\n\n\n# Create an empty figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))\n\n# Plot the spatially joined polygon\neji_palisades_join.plot(ax=ax, \n                        color=\"lightblue\", \n                        edgecolor=\"white\", \n                        linewidth=0.5,\n                        label=\"Intersecting EJI Tracts\")\n\n# Plot the Palisades fire boundaries\npalis_fire.boundary.plot(ax=ax,\n                         color=\"red\",\n                         linewidth=2,\n                         label=\"Palisades Fire Perimeter\")\n\n# Create a legend patch for EJI census tracts intersecting the fire perimeter\neji_patch = mpatches.Patch(\n    color=\"lightblue\", \n    label=\"Intersecting EJI Tracts\")\n\n# Create a legend patch for the Palisades fire perimeter\npalis_patch = mpatches.Patch(\n    facecolor=\"none\", \n    edgecolor=\"red\",\n    linewidth=2,\n    label=\"Palisades Fire Perimeter\")\n\n# Add title and legend\nax.set_title(\"EJI Census Tracts Intersecting the Palisades Fire Perimeter\")\nax.legend(handles=[eji_patch, palis_patch], title=\"Layers\", loc='lower left')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of the Palisades Fire, several entire census tracts fall completely inside the fire perimeter, while others intersect only along the edges. This means the fire footprint is large relative to the size of nearby census tracts, covering substantial portions of the local communities. Unlike many wildfires that only clip small parts of multiple tracts, the Palisades Fire burned through whole tracts, indicating that the impacted population and built environment may span multiple full census units.\nThe same process was repeated for the Eaton fire perimeter, resulting in a dataset of EJI census tracts that intersect the fire boundary.\n\n# Get the EJI tracts intersecting the eaton fire perimeter\neji_eaton_join = gpd.sjoin(ca_eji, eaton_fire, how='inner', predicate='intersects')\n\n\n# Create empty figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))\n\n# Plot the spatially joined polygon\neji_eaton_join.plot(\n    ax=ax, \n    color=\"lightblue\", \n    edgecolor=\"white\", \n    linewidth=0.5,\n    label=\"Intersecting EJI Tracts\"\n)\n\n# Plot the Eaton fire boundaries\neaton_fire.boundary.plot(\n    ax=ax,\n    color=\"red\",\n    linewidth=2,\n    label=\"Eaton Fire Perimeter\"\n)\n\n# Create a legend patch for EJI census tracts intersecting the fire perimeter\neji_patch = mpatches.Patch(\n    color=\"lightblue\", \n    label=\"Intersecting EJI Tracts\")\n\n# Create a legend patch for the Eaton fire perimeter\neaton_patch = mpatches.Patch(\n    facecolor=\"none\", \n    edgecolor=\"red\",\n    linewidth=2,\n    label=\"Eaton Fire Perimeter\")\n\n# Add title and legend\nax.set_title(\"EJI Census Tracts Intersecting the Eaton Fire Perimeter\")\nax.legend(handles=[eji_patch, eaton_patch], title=\"Layers\", loc='lower left')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike the Palisades fire, the Eaton fire boundary is small relative to the size of census tracts. Only a few tracts intersect the fire perimeter, and each tract contains a much larger land area than the fire itself. This illustrates that tract-level EJ metrics aggregate social information across regions far larger than the fire footprint.\n\nClipping Census Tracts to Fire Perimeters\nAfter identifying the census tracts that intersect each fire perimeter using spatial joins, the next step is to refine the analysis by clipping the Environmental Justice Index (EJI) census tracts to the exact boundaries of the Palisades and Eaton fires.\n\n# Clip tracts to the palisades and eaton fire perimeters\neji_palis_clip = gpd.clip(ca_eji, palis_fire)\neji_eaton_clip = gpd.clip(ca_eji, eaton_fire)\n\n\n\nDifference Between a Spatial Join and Clipping\nSpatial Join gpd.sjoin()\nReturns entire census tracts that touch the fire perimeter and the geometry remains unchanged.\nClipping gpd.clip()\nReturns only the portion of each tract inside the fire perimeter and the geometry is modified.\n\n\n\nCreate Visualization with the Eaton and Palisades Boundaries with the Basemap Using contextily\nIn this visualization, the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters are overlaid on a basemap using the contextily library to provide geographic context. Displaying both boundaries together helps illustrate their relative locations and extents within Los Angeles County and supports interpretation of subsequent spatial analyses.\n\n# Reproject to Web Mercator for basemap\npalisades_3857 = palis_fire.to_crs(epsg=3857)\neaton_3857 = eaton_fire.to_crs(epsg=3857)\n\n# Get bounds from each fire\npminx, pminy, pmaxx, pmaxy = palisades_3857.total_bounds\neminx, eminy, emaxx, emaxy = eaton_3857.total_bounds\n\nminx = min(pminx, eminx)\nminy = min(pminy, eminy)\nmaxx = max(pmaxx, emaxx)\nmaxy = max(pmaxy, emaxy)\n\n# Plot the map, starting with an empty figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 10))\n\n# Set zoom *before* adding basemap\nbuffer = 2000  # small padding around the fire\nax.set_xlim(minx - buffer, maxx + buffer)\nax.set_ylim(miny - buffer, maxy + buffer)\n\n# Add basemap\nctx.add_basemap(ax, source=ctx.providers.OpenStreetMap.Mapnik, zoom=13)\n\n# Plot fire boundaries\npalisades_3857.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color=\"red\", linewidth=2, label=\"Palisades Fire\")\neaton_3857.boundary.plot(ax=ax, color=\"blue\", linewidth=2, label=\"Eaton Fire\")\n\n# Legend + title\nax.legend(loc = 'upper left')\nax.set_title(\"Eaton and Palisades Fire Perimeters on Basemap\")\nax.axis(\"off\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map above displays the locations and extents of the Palisades Fire (outlined in red) and the Eaton Fire (outlined in blue) over a detailed OpenStreetMap basemap of the Los Angeles region. Overlaying the fire boundaries on a familiar street-level basemap allows for clear interpretation of their urban and ecological contexts. This map shows the proximity of the perimeters to major roadways, neighborhoods and parks."

    "text": "From Physical Burn Severity to Social Impact\nAfter establishing the geographic context of the Eaton and Palisades fires using a basemap and official fire perimeters, I examined social vulnerability within the affected areas. I plotted census tracts symbolized by the percentage of persons with a disability (E_DISABL) using the 2024 California Environmental Justice Index dataset. This map highlights the spatial distribution of disability prevalence among census tracts intersecting the Eaton and Palisades fire perimeters. This visualization allows for a clearer understanding of how wildfire exposure overlaps with communities that may face additional challenges during evacuation, emergency response, and recovery. By visualizing this variable at the census-tract level, the map provides critical context for understanding social vulnerability alongside the physical extent of the fires.\n\n# Create empty figure\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20, 10))\n\n# Percentage of persons with a disability\neji_variable = 'E_DISABL'\n\n# Find shared min/max across both datasets\nvmin = min(eji_palis_clip[eji_variable].min(),\n           eji_eaton_clip[eji_variable].min())\n\nvmax = max(eji_palis_clip[eji_variable].max(),\n           eji_eaton_clip[eji_variable].max())\n\n# --- Palisades plot ---\neji_palis_clip.plot(\n    column=eji_variable,\n    vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\n    legend=False,\n    ax=ax1,\n    cmap=\"viridis\"\n)\nax1.set_title('Percent Population with Disability\\n(Palisades Fire Area)')\nax1.axis('off')\n\n# --- Eaton plot ---\neji_eaton_clip.plot(\n    column=eji_variable,\n    vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax,\n    legend=False,\n    ax=ax2,\n    cmap=\"viridis\"\n)\n\n#  Add a title for the map\nax2.set_title('Percent Population with Disability\\n(Eaton Fire Area)')\nax2.axis('off')\n\n# Create a subtitle\nfig.suptitle('E_DISABL – Disability Percentages\\nComparison of Census Tracts Within Each Fire Perimeter',\n             fontsize=16)\n\n# Shared horizontal colorbar\nsm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(norm=plt.Normalize(vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax))\ncbar_ax = fig.add_axes([0.25, 0.08, 0.5, 0.02]) \ncbar = fig.colorbar(sm, cax=cbar_ax, orientation='horizontal')\ncbar.set_label('Percent of Population With a Disability (E_DISABL)')\n\nplt.show()\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;Figure size 640x480 with 0 Axes&gt;\n\n\nThe distribution of E_DISABL, or the percent of residents with disabilities, differs noticeably between the census tracts intersecting the Palisades and Eaton fire perimeters. In the Palisades area, disability percentages are generally lower and more varied, with many tracts falling in the lower end of the color scale. In contrast, the Eaton fire area shows consistently higher disability rates across most tracts, with several communities displaying some of the highest values in the comparison. These differences have important implications for wildfire relief and recovery efforts. Communities with higher proportions of residents with disabilities may face additional challenges during evacuation, communication, and rebuilding phases. This means that emergency managers and recovery planners may need to allocate more targeted resources like accessible transportation, medical support, and long-term housing assistance to the Eaton area to ensure equitable and effective wildfire response."
