# Introduction

As the global population continues to rise, so does the pressure on wild fisheries to meet growing seafood demand. Marine aquaculture offers a promising solution, providing a sustainable alternative that can relieve pressure on wild stocks while supporting economic development. According to Gentry et al. (2017), the availability of suitable ocean space is unlikely to limit the expansion of marine aquaculture, indicating that many regions have the physical capacity to support future growth. This presents an important opportunity for countries such as the United States to develop aquaculture systems that meet both economic and environmental objectives. Thus, the central objective of this project is to identify which areas along the U.S. West Coast meet the environmental conditions necessary to support sustainable aquaculture development.

Identifying where aquaculture can be responsibly developed requires evaluating the environmental conditions that support healthy growth and minimize ecological impacts. This project assesses the suitability of West Coast Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) for marine aquaculture using two key environmental constraints: sea surface temperature (SST) and bathymetry. Using satellite-derived SST data from 2008–2012 and a regional bathymetry dataset, the total area within each EEZ that meets species-specific environmental thresholds can be quantified. The analysis focuses on two groups: oysters, which are already widely cultivated in California, and the Purple Hinged Rock Scallop (*Crassadoma gigantea*), a giant scallop species with emerging aquaculture potential (Culver et al., 2022). By integrating spatial environmental data with habitat requirements, this project identifies where conditions are most favorable for expanding sustainable marine aquaculture along the U.S. West Coast.

# Methods

To assess aquaculture suitability along the U.S. West Coast, a generalized function was implemented that automates the processing of sea surface temperature (SST), bathymetry, and EEZ boundary data. Depth requirements for the purple-hinged rock scallop (*Crassadoma gigantea*) were obtained from SeaLifeBase, which reports an ecological depth range of 0–80 m below sea level (b.s.l.) (University of British Columbia, 2025; Harbo, 1997). Thermal tolerance data for this species are not provided in SeaLifeBase, so temperature thresholds were derived from Reef Life Survey observations, which indicate a temperature range of approximately 13.3–22.1 degrees Celsius (Schmid, 2025). In addition, suitability thresholds for oysters were incorporated based on published ecological ranges, with optimal SST values between 11–30 degrees Celsius and depth values between 0 and 70 meters b.s.l. These values were used to define species-specific suitability thresholds for reclassification of SST and bathymetry data. The workflow consisted of four phases. 

## 1. Sea Surface Temperature Processing

Daily 5-km SST averages from 2008–2012 were compiled and converted into a single long-term mean SST raster. The datasets were first stacked and then averaged by pixel. SST values, originally in Kelvin, were converted to degrees Celsius. 

## 2. Bathymetry Processing

A regional depth raster was reprojected to match the SST coordinate reference system (CRS). The bathymetry was cropped to the spatial extent of the SST data and resampled to its resolution to maintain consistency and cell alignment between rasters. 

## 3. Environmental Suitability Classification

Species-specific temperature and depth constraints were translated into binary suitability surfaces. For the purple-hinged rock scallop (*Crassadoma gigantea*), SST values between 13.3–22.1 Celsius and depths between 0–80 meters b.s.l. were classified as suitable (value = 1), with all other values set to unsuitable (value = 0). In contrast, for oysters, suitability was defined by a broader SST range of 11–30 degrees Celsius and shallower depths between 0 and 70 meters b.s.l. Separate binary rasters were generated for each species, and suitability layers were multiplied to produce combined indices identifying locations that simultaneously satisfied both environmental conditions.

## 4. Suitability Estimation at the EEZ Level

Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) boundaries were transformed to match the SST projection. The combined suitability raster was masked to the extent of each EEZ, and the area of each raster cell was computed in square kilometers. Suitable cell areas were aggregated within each EEZ to obtain total suitable area per region. These results were subsequently merged with the EEZ polygon dataset and visualized using a colorblind-friendly continuous color scale.

# Data Analysis

The workflow was applied for the oysters and using their ecological parameters to demonstrate the process before generalizing it.

To avoid repeating the oyster workflow for each species, we implemented a generalized function that accepts species-specific parameters.

```{r,echo=TRUE,results='hide'}
#|label: oyster-function
source(here("R","suitability_function.R")) 

oyster_results <- map_suitability(tmin = 11, tmax = 30,
                                  dmin = -70, dmax = 0,
                                  species_name = "Oysters")
```

We then tested the function with scallop parameters to confirm that the function can be applied to any species of interest and their ecological parameters.

```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
#|label: scallop-function
scallop_results <- map_suitability(tmin = 13.3, tmax = 22.1,
                                   dmin = -80, dmax = 0,
                                   species_name = "Purple-Hinged Rock Scallops")
```

The analysis identified stark differences in the amount of environmentally suitable area for aquaculture across West Coast EEZ regions. For oysters, Central California and Southern California contained the largest suitable areas, with approximately 4,070 squared km and 3,757 squared km respectively, followed by Washington (2,378 squared km) and Oregon (1,074 squared km). Northern California showed a more limited suitable habitat (178 squared km). In contrast, suitable areas for purple-hinged rock scallops were highly concentrated in the southern portion of the study region. Southern California accounted for nearly all suitable habitat (3,567 squared km), with a small area in Central California (119 km²), while Oregon, Washington, and Northern California contained no suitable area based on the species’ temperature and depth thresholds.

# Discussion
The results highlight the clear spatial differences in aquaculture suitability driven by environmental constraints associated with sea surface temperature and bathymetry. Oyster suitability was broadly distributed across the West Coast, with the greatest concentrations being in Central and Southern California. These regions offer both the depth and thermal ranges that align with oyster tolerance. These thresholds resulted in several thousand square kilometers of potentially viable habitat. Washington and Oregon also contained meaningful amounts of suitable area, although to a lesser extent. The distribution pattern suggests that oyster aquaculture has relatively flexible environmental requirements within this coastline. This finding indicates that aquaculture suitability for oysters spans across multiple EEZs.

In contrast, the distribution of suitable habitat for purple-hinged rock scallops was comparatively restricted. Southern California dominated the available area, as it contributed to nearly all suitable habitat identified in the study, with only a small area in Central California meeting threshold conditions. The absence of suitable areas in Oregon, Washington, and Northern California indicates that the species’ temperature range limits its potential along the cooler northern waters. These results align with the species’ known geographic distribution, as purple-hinged rock scallops are more frequently associated with subtidal, subtropical environments (Culver et al., 2022).

The stark contrast between the two species underscores the importance of evaluating on a species-specific level and considering their environmental thresholds when evaluating aquaculture potential. While oysters demonstrate broad tolerance across the West Coast, the purple-hinged rock scallop is limited to a much smaller geographic range despite being a native species. From a planning perspective, this means that opportunities to expand scallop aquaculture are highly geographically concentrated, while oyster aquaculture can be distributed more widely. Further research is needed to translate these metrics into practical site selection, like evaluating regulatory conditions, ecological interactions, and infrastructure considerations.
